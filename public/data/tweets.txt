An ESL teacher working in Korea witnesses a bank robbery. The police question her as a witness...

Police: I understand you were the key witness for the robbery.

Woman: Yes, I was the only other person in the bank besides the tellers.

Police: Are you okay to answer some questions for me?

Woman: Sure. I don't know how much help I'll be. He made me get on the ground so I didn't get a very good look at him.

Police: Was he carrying a weapon?

Woman: Yes, he had a pistol in his back pocket. He threatened to use it, but I doubt it was loaded.

Police: What makes you say that?

Woman: He was just a kid. Probably fifteen or younger.

Police: Can you describe him for me?

Woman: He was Asian. Probably five foot six. He was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses. I can't remember what else he was wearing.

Police: Did he talk directly to you? I mean, did he ask you for your money or anything?

Woman: No, he just told me to get on the ground. That's all I know. I'm running late for a class. Is it okay if I go now?

Police: I just want to get your name and phone number. If you think of anything else, please notify us.
